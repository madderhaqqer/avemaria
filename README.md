This project is the scriptures of the Douay Rheims 1582 New Testament, and 1610 Old Testament
Most modernization was avoided
What is modern is the access
The crosses which served as placeholders for verse numbers were exchanged for the verse number
Archaic characters are retained as much as possible
Archaic spelling was retained as much as possible
The annotations were not kept

Every Douay Rheims that has easy access or an app today repeats the following
They use one of various revisions of the Douay Rheims
They revise and update the spelling
They fail to retain the archaic letters

This leads to the only access of the original Douay Rheims being a PDF without links
to Chapter and Verse. 

Therefore the goal is to copy as faithfully as possible the original text and retain
what is archaic in it while modernizing it's ease of access.
